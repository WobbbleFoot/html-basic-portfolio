<h2>Top 5 Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>One of the best Cinematic Non-Fiction Storytelling movies of all time; No we aren't arguing about this.</p>

<h3>The Death of Stalin</h3>
<p>Really funny and surprisingly accurate! Caught me by surprise the first time I watched it. Also I love the accents.</p>

<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>A heart touching film that deeply moves me everytime I watch it. Shows the grotesqueness of it all in Nazi Germany.</p>

<h3>All Quiet On The Western Front</h3>
<p>A film, unlike others, that does not glorify wars and shows the horror of it all.</p>

<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<p>A cult classic. Reminds me to live life for myself and not for others.</p>
